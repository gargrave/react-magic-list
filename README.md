# react-magic-list

A simple virtualized list React component. Render tens of thousands of elements without dragging your DOM through the mud!

Be warned: this is mostly just an experiment/learning exercise. Use this in production _at your own risk_.

More details to come in future.

For now, if you want to see it at work, you can take a look at the Styleguidist example:

- Clone the repo
- Run `yarn`
- Run `yarn styleguide`
